    "## Brainstorming Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflect on your personal experiences and observations in COMP110 and **brainstorm modifications to the course that _create value_ beyond its current design**. When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each brainstormed idea should state a. the suggested change or addition, b. what the expected value created, and c. which specific stakeholders would benefit.  If helpful, expand on the following template \"The course should (state idea here) because it will (state value created here) for (insert stakeholders here).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example A: \"The course should use only examples from psychology experiments because it will be more relevant for students who are psychology majors.\"\n",

    "Example B: \"The course should not have post-lesson questions because they are not useful for most students in the class.\""

This course should offer additional workshops for the students enrolled who intend to major or minor in Computer Science(BS/BA) in order to expose them to the field and give them extra challenges/things to work on in order to allow them to get there foot in the door as early as possible. \n",
    "2. This course should offer a lesson for the students enrolled about what it means to major/minor in Computer Science describing  what doors it could open as well as the difference between a BS and a BA. \n",

    "5. This course should continue office hours 1:1 appointments because it is an efficient system that allows the students enrolled to connect with more experienced students and learn from them. However, they should enforce the 15 minute limit more strictly in order to meet the demand. "

One aspect of _continuous improvement_ is trying to avoid \"tunnel vision\" where possible improvements are not considered because there is no data available to analyze it.

This lesson might even spark interest in people who just took COMP 110 to fulfill a general education course requirement. "

From personal experience and the known experience of my peers, online class is easy to get distracted from. Often time students stare at the screen, nod their heads, and move on. By having all classes be synchronous, it opens the door for more engaging lectures of tuesdays. While the post video lesson questions help students pay attention, I believe just having the class be synchronous would be even more helpful. Having all synchronous classes, would allow us and our grades to benefit from available input and collaboration from our peers, TA's, and professor. \n"

    "### Part 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "    The data analyzed in the cells above do not support my idea of making all classes in this course synchronous. I analyzed the data in three parts. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    First, I created two graphs: one showing the students' enrolled responses to if they completed the lecture’s lessons during the hours of the day registered for the course (the synchronous time) and another graph showing their responses to if they believe having all synchronous classes would improve their performance in the class. Just from that graph, you can already tell that most students said they do not do the lesson assignment during the synchronous times. From the graph, it can also be seen that most students also did not believe all synchronous classes would improve their performance in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Second, to further analyze the graph and responses to the two questions mentioned, I made my own function, `count_certain_values` that showed the amount of people that responded with a 4, 5, 6, and 7.  4, to me, was the minimum level of agreement that could be taken into consideration for my data because it meant people leaned more towards agree than disagree. When I used `count_certain_values` on both lesson_time and sync_perf, it is seen that less than half of the responses were at an agreement level of 4 or higher. This meant most people did not do the video lessons at the same time as a sychronous class would be and most people did not agree that having all synchronous classes would improve their performance. If the majority of people did do the video lessons at the synchronous class time, I would've been able to argue that they would not have a problem coming to class at that time and prefer the structure of having a certain time to do things. But unfortunately, that is not the case according to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Third, I used the head, columnar, and select functions to be able to see the first 50 responses to ls_effective which asked if students enrolled thought the video lessons were effective. The overwhelming majority of the first 50 responses to this question were at a level of agreement of 4 or above. Because of the overwhelming majority of 4's or higher shown from just the first 50 responses, it was safe to assume the rest of the responses would also look like that. Therefore, this piece of data also did not support my idea. If people think the lesson videos are effective the way they are, why take them away and transition to synchronous tuesday classes? That would just end up being potentially less effective for the class as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "    After looking at all the data I analyzed, I realize now that it may harm us more than help us as a class to switch to all synchronous classes. Most people clearly enjoy and thrive in the way COMP 110 is set up currently. In my opinion, it would not be right to risk the success of the majority for the success of the minority. I understand why most people would want the class to stay set up in the way that it is. By having one asynchronous class day and one synchronous class day, it allows the students enrolled to have the best of both worlds. They are given flexibity to do the Tuesday lesson and assignment on their own time and pause when they need to in order to take in the information better or just take a needed break. However, theya are also given the opportunity to be in class, ask questions, and collaborate. As a busy college student myself, I see the validity in this and therefore, the validity of my findings. An alternate idea I would explore is the idea that COMP 110 should be taught in the same language COMP 210 is taught in because it will prepare the students enrolled who intend to major/minor in Computer Science to take COMP 210 and be succesful. I could use similar methods to see how many of the students enrolled in COMP 110 intend to major/minor in Computer Science and go from there. I think it would really benefit us, especially the beginners who want to major in Computer Science without having prior experience before COMP 110. \n",
